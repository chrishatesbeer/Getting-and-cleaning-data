# Getting-and-cleaning-data
There is a single script called run_analysis.R, which does the following <br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
4. ppropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>
<br>
